Now I want to you to implement a prune mutation function, which takes tree object clf and the node_id to be pruned as input and outputs new tree with updated datasets at leaf and updated node_ids and also updates features_used with features used in new pruned tree:
Here is the high level approach:
If the sibling of the node to be pruned is leaf: then combine datasets at both leaves and make the parent as leaf and store the dataset.
If the sibling of the node to be pruned is internal node: then make the sibling as root and apply predict on the new tree on dataset stored at pruned leaf.

In both the cases the node will be pruned (removed) so node_ids will be updated, features used in the tree will also be updated and 
the new tree will be returned. Implement it as a separate function so that current code is not much affected.
